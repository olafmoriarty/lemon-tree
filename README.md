# Lemon Tree

A script that lets the user enter their BlueSky username and password, and displays a list of suggested BlueSky users to follow based on who that user follows.

This is just a quick experiment I made to explore what can be done with [the BlueSky API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atproto/api). It was surprisingly easy -- this entire code sample was made in an afternoon -- so I strongly recommend playing around with the APIs.

## Use cases for Lemon Tree
* When you're sitting there in a boring room
* When it's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
* When you're wasting your time and have nothing to do
* When nothing every happens, and you wonder
* When you'd like to change your point of view
* When you feel so lonely, waiting for someone to follow
* When you wonder how,\
  and you wonder why,\
  yesterday everybody told you about the blue BlueSky,\
  but all that you can see\
  is just an empty Following feed
* When you're turning your head up and down,\
  turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around,\
  and all that you can see\
  is just another empty feed
